# Mini Project: Pyramid Pattern Generator

## Description

This project is a **JavaScript-based exercise** that generates a pyramid pattern using a specified character. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts, including loops, string manipulation, and dynamic row generation.

The pyramid can be customized with different characters, row counts, and alignment styles. The code outputs the pattern to the console. _#freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects_

### Example Output

## Features

-   **Loops and Iteration**
    -   Generates rows for the pyramid dynamically.
-   **String Manipulation**
    -   Pads rows with spaces for alignment.
-   **Customization**
    -   Easily change the pyramid character, row count, and alignment (e.g., inverted).

## How To Use

1. Open the file in a JavaScript environment (e.g., Node.js, browser console).
2. Modify the variables:
    - `character` to set the pyramid character.
    - `count` to set the number of rows.
    - `inverted` to toggle between normal and inverted pyramid alignment.
3. Run the script to see the output in the console.

This project is a standalone exercise for learning and practice purposes. Contributions are welcome to improve or extend the project.
